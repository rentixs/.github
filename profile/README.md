## 🚀 What is Rentix?

**Rentix** is a next-gen resource rental platform — enabling anyone to share or consume computing resources like containers, RAM disks, or custom workloads.

Everything runs securely, in real time, and under your control — powered by a lightweight agent and open APIs.

---

## 🔐 Security & Isolation

Rentix was designed with **host safety and tenant sandboxing** in mind:

- Agent runs in isolated mode (namespace/VM/container)
- Resource-level access control
- Encrypted communication and remote execution
---

## 🌍 For Everyone — Not Just Developers

**Rentix** empowers *anyone* to share or rent computing resources — whether you're hosting a gaming server, running isolated workloads, sharing RAM disks, or deploying company infrastructure.

Perfect for:

- 🎮 **Gamers** — host private servers or mods from your own machine
- 🧑‍💼 **Companies** — scale services with user-provided infrastructure
- 🧑‍🔬 **Power users** — run RAM disks, temp instances, or test labs
- 🧰 **Sysadmins & integrators** — automate provisioning & monitoring
- 🧑‍💻 **Developers** — build and share sandboxed environments

No vendor lock-in. Full control. Truly distributed.
